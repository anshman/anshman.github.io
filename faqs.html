		                                    FitInfinite is a realtime fitness booking system. Think Uber, but for fitness. Users can either find other users to train together with (either by arranging a session that other users can join or by joining an already existing session), or book a training session with a professional fitness instructor for one or more people. Search results are presented based on the user’s location, and the time and sport/workout type preferences they have selected. Payment to professional fitness instructors for a booked session is immediate and handled directly through the app.

		                                    First of all, start with uploading a profile picture that shows your professionalism and inspires trust. This is more about showing how good a trainer you are, not flaunting your muscles :) Make sure you also provide a profile description introducing who you are, your background and professional qualifications, your expertise and the services you offer. Then, provide a detailed list of the sports/workout types users can contact you about and the locations you cover. Make sure you always update your availability - if users contact you to book a session and it turns out you’re not available, it could put them off from contacting you again. Finally, be as responsive as can be to user messages.

		                                    Once you've unlocked your Professional Toolkit you will need to set up a Stripe account to accept payments via FitInfinite. This is very easy to do and only take a couple of minutes. Stripe will automatically transfer any money you've earned via FitInfinite (minus any fees) to your nominated bank account every seven days. It can take up to 10 days for you to receive your first payment however.</p>
