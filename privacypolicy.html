							<b>About Us</b><br>
                <p>We, FitInfinite Limited, are committed to protecting your privacy and personal data. This Privacy and Cookie Policy (Privacy Policy) details the steps we take to protect your personal data when you download and use our FitInfinite app (App). It describes the personal data that we collect, the purposes for which we use such personal data, and your choices regarding our use of it. Our legal status under UK data protection law is that of a data controller and in this capacity we will securely store and process your personal data which you have provided to us. Data controller is a legal term used in the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal data.  As data controller we have registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office and our registration number is ZA114548. The steps we take to protect your personal data and how you can review and correct your personal data are also covered here. By downloading and using our App, you are consenting to the data collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
                <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Please ensure that you frequently check this Privacy Policy for any updates.</p>

		<b>Collection of personal data</b><br>
		<p>By using our App and by submitting personal data to us through our App then this Privacy Policy will apply. This Privacy Policy will apply whether you are a User or a Trainer (as defined in our <a href="termsandconditions.html">Terms of Use</a>) unless the context implies otherwise.</p>

    <p>You are not required to provide all of this personal data, but if you do not, we may not be able to experience all of the services available on the App.</p>

    <b>How is your personal data used?</b><br>

		We will use the personal data you provide to us to:<br>
        <li>provide our services to you;</li>
        <li>allow you to make contact with other App users and Fitness Professionals;</li>
        <li>share your profile with other users of the App;</li>
        <li>share your personal data with other our partners (detailed below);</li>

        <li>contact you; and</li>
		<li>send out email alerts you may have signed up for.</li><br>

  <b>With whom is your personal data shared?</b><br>
		<p>We may gather depersonalised data about you (such as aggregated statistics) in order to create traffic patterns, location patterns, demographic information, or to allow prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other third parties to do the same. This depersonalised data will not be able to personally identify you.</p>
		We may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal data. Examples of the type of situation where this would occur would be: <li>in the administration of justice; or
    <li>where we have to defend ourselves legally.</li><br>
		<p>Finally, in the event of a reorganisation, sale or takeover we may need to disclose personal data.</p>

    <b>The requirements of Data Protection Laws</b><br>
		We regard the lawful and correct treatment of your personal data by us as very important to our successful operation, and to maintaining confidence between us and our users. We ensure that our organisation treats personal data lawfully and correctly. To this end we fully endorse and adhere to the 'Data Protection Principles' set out in the Act. In particular, without your consent or first amending this Privacy Policy to reflect any change in our usage of personal data:<br>
      <li>we will not use your personal data for any purpose that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy;
      <li>we will only collect sufficient personal data for the uses set out above;
      <li>we will endeavour to keep your personal data up-to-date;
      <li>we will not retain your personal data longer than necessary unless required to do so by law;
      <li>we will operate appropriate technical and organisational processes to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful access or processing and against accidental loss or destruction. The detailed measures we take are described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy; and
		<li>we will not transfer your personal data to a country outside the European Economic Area unless safeguards are in place to protect your personal data to the standards that apply within the EEA.</li><br>
